========

**deviantART Sta.sh** is a WordPress Plugin that allows a WordPress user to let the site connect to their [deviantART](http://www.deviantart.com/) [Sta.sh](http://sta.sh/) account and manipulate their stashed resources.

Currently in alpha, only connecting via Oauth, `placebo`, `whoami` and `delta` API calls are implemented.
